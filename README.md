# Supplementary Course Resources

This is the code repository for [Microsoft Power BI - A Complete Introduction [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/virtualization-and-cloud/devops-fundamentals-and-cicd-video?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781789347661), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.

You may use these resources to compare your project state against our project (e.g. to find + fix errors) or to download and view the slides shown in the lectures.

# How To Find The Right Resources

The resources are organized into various branches. **Every branch (except for the "main" branch) belongs to a specific course section** - the branch name indicates which section it belongs to. For example, the branch [01-getting-started](PacktPublishing/Microsoft-Power-BI---A-Complete-Introduction-2022-EDITION/tree/01-getting-started) belongs to the first course section "Getting Started".

The "main" branch contains all source files used in the course and the course slides.

Inside the branches for a specific module, you find the project files for different lectures in the corresponding section.

# Using The Project Snapshots

After switching to a specific branch, you find the project snapshots in this branch.

You can download the files inside a branch via the "Code" button. After reconnecting the .pbix file to the corresponding files in the "source-files" folder in the "main" branch you can continue working on the project.

More information on how to reconnect the source files after downloading data from GitHub can be found at the end of the first course module.
