# Using The Project Snapshots

After switching to a specific branch, you will find the project snapshots in this branch.

You can download the files inside a branch via the "Code" button. After reconnecting the .pbix file to the corresponding files in the "source-files" folder in the "main" branch, you can continue working on the project.

More information on how to reconnect the source files after downloading data from GitHub can be found at the end of the first course module.
